There is no existing code to merge with. The instruction is to rename the file `public/images/histoire.jpg` to `public/images/histoire/debut.jpg`. Since there is no code content associated with the original file, there is nothing to output. The update instruction also provides a URL to a placeholder SVG, but this doesn't imply any code content either. Therefore, there is no code to be placed within the `<merged_code>` tags.
